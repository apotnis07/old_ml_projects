The notion of this project is to simplify the way in which we
interact with our devices. The feature of using image and
voice recognition is much more intuitive than the traditional
methods of inputting the data ourselves. It builds upon the
need of the time to make things easier to use. And it doesn’t
get more easier than using your own voice to get your work
done. The project focuses on the basic applications of image
and voice recognition which can be incorporated in our daily
lives. It can be used to make simple calculations as well as get
the physical written material in digital form.
